## Description
<img src="assets/Social_Network_API.gif">
<br>
I'll be building a an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js Links to an external site.and Mongoose Links to an external site.packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
